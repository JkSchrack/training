Network Protocols
	Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - Translatres IP addresses to MAC addresses
	Domain Name System (DNS) - Translates domain name to IP address
	Dynamic Host Confiuguration Protocol (DHCP) - Assigns IP addresses to endpoints (physical device that connects to a network)
	File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - Client-server file transfer, used for private file sharing
	Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - File sharing over web-browser, HTTP connets to server and request web files (such as HTML)
	Internet Protocol - (IP) - Sending/receiving of packets (data) to their destination
		Packet - A unit of data consisting of a header and payload (Header contains routing information)
	Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - Assembles and organizes packets, error correction too

IP Addresses
	Public IP Address - External facing IP address used by device (router/modem/gateway) that connects to ISP
	Private IP Address - Internal facing IP address, assigned by LAN network manager (router/modem/gateway) used by end-points. 
	Static IP Address - Manually assigned IP address
	Dynamic IP Address - DHCP assigned IP address

	IP Address Structure
		- IP addresses consists of 32 bits, 4 octects (8-bit sections); <section_1>.<section_2>.<section_3>.<section_4>
		- IP addresses are made up of two portions, a network (network address) and host (specific device) portion

	Subnet - Logical subdivision of an IP network
		- Improves network performance, enhances network security, optimizes IP address utlization, facilitates network management
	
	Subnet Mask - Determines how many bits of an IP address correspond to for the network partition
		- Subnet masks consist of 32 bits, with a sequence of 1s followed by a sequence of 0s
		- Sequences of 1s indicate which bits of the IP address correspond to the network portion, 0s indicate which bits correspond to host portion
			Subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (aka 11111111.11111111.11111111.0) indicate the first 3 sections of the IP correspond to the network portion

	Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) Notation - Compact way of indiciating a subnet
		- '/x' after an IP address indicates X number of bits refer to network portion
			192.168.100.0/24 means the first 24 bits correspond to network portion. Hence 192.168.100.0/24 == 192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0 == Network Portion = 192.168.100 && Host Portion = .0 

	Subnet Classes
		Class A (/8) - First 8 bits used for the network; Supports up to 16,777,214 hosts
		Class B (/16) - First 16 bits used for the network; Supports up to 65,534 hosts
		Class C (/24) - First 24 bits used for the network; Supports up to 254 hosts


Reserved IP Addresses
	0.0.0.0 - Local network
	10.0.0.0 - Private network
	127.0.0.0 - Loopback addresses (used by a computer to identify itself)
	192.168.0.0 - Local communication within a private network
	255.255.255.255 - Used to broadcast a message to every computer on a network 

Reserved Ports
	20 - FTP (data transfer)
	21 - FTP (control command)
	22 - SSH (secure logins/file transfers and port forwarding)
	23 - Telnet (unencrypted text communication)
	25 - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, email routing)
	53 - DNS
	69 - TFTP
	80 - HTTP
	156 - SQL Service
	443 - HTTPS
