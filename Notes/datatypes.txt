boolean - 1 byte - stores true/false
char - 1 byte - stores a single character/letter/number/ascii value
int - 2 or 4 bytes - stores whole number (no decimals)
float - 4 bytes - stores fractional number (numbers with one or more decimal); up to 7 digits
double - 8 bytes - a float but stores up to 15 digits

Queue - (FIFO)First in First Out
Stack - (LIFO)Last In First Out

Pointers -> https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/
	Pointer: Variable that stores the address of another variable
  	Address-of Operator(&): Obtains address of a variable
  	Dereference Operator(*): Obtains value of a pointer
    	Ex. variable = 7, pointer = &variable == 0xffffcbc0 (Memory Address), *pointer == 7
 
Pass By Value vs Reference
 	Pass by Value: Caller and callee have two independent variables with the same value
    	Ex. Caller: passByVal(val), Callee: passByVal(type val) {...}
    	
    Pass by Reference: Caller and the callee use the same variable for the parameter
     	Ex. Caller: passByRef(&val), Callee: passByRef(type &val) {...}
    
    	Derivatives by Pass by Reference:
    		Ex. Caller: passPtr(ptrName), Callee: passPtr(type *ptrName) {...}
    		Ex. Caller: passRef(refName), Callee: passRef(type &refName) {...}
    		Ex. Caller: passPtrArg(&varName), Callee: passPtrArg(type *ptrName) {...}
  	
  	Ex. Caller: passByPtr(*val), Callee: passByRef(type *val) {...}

Linked List
	Node - || <data> | <next> ||; Where next is a pointer to the next linked list
	Header - First node in a chain of linked lists
